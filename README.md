## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Run a browser with a MetaMask-wallet
  - You need a wallet to connect to a Web3 application (dApp)

### Installation

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Usage

**Run the project locally with the following commands:**

```bash
$ npx hardhat node
$ npx scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
$ npm run dev
```

By running the node locally you'll be provided with multiple test-accounts with funds that can be used to test the dApp. Import the account to MetaMask and use the imported account to interact with the dApp.

Assuming you have a MetaMask wallet in your browser, you should be able to interact with the dApp.
